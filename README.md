# OOP-Assignment
I coded this assignment using a lot of the resources from your github and my own knowledge of code. I am most proud of the stars feature because this took a great amount of effort and fiddling around with the code to get this done. I am also quite proud of the gun feature because I figured out most of this myself like making sure the bullets did not shoot from inside the ship and adding the reload function for after 100 bullets were shot. Then I added the counter to the screen to display when the clip was empty.

I also then could not add sound due to processing not connecting to the server. I spent a long time trying to do this which stopped me from getting as much done as I had hoped. I really would have like to add destructible objects to shoot at and to add a dynamic compass and speedometer but I renstalled processing a number of times trying to fix the issue with the libraries.
